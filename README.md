## [hello-world](hello-world)

I tried to cross compile with CMake (between not only armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a, but also C and CPP).

It was big help to understand CMake and Android Cross Compiling with NDK.

## [interface-list](interface-list)

To do this, I need to cross compile libpcap in arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a.

While doing this, I understand -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, concept of CMake's root directory, and difference of static and shared linking.
